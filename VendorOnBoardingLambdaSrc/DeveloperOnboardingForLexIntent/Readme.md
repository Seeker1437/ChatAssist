# Amazon Lex Getting Started Book Trip Bot Code Hooks

This starter project consists of:
* Function.cs - The entry point for the Lambda function that chooses the IIntentProcessor to process and execute the processor
* BookCarIntentProcessor - Intent processor for the BookCar intent
* BookHotelIntentProcessor - Intent processor for the BookHotel intent 
* aws-lambda-tools-defaults.json - default argument settings for use with Visual Studio and command line deployment tools for AWS

You may also have a test project depending on the options selected.

This sample demonstrates an implementation of the Lex Code Hook Interface
in order to serve a sample bot which manages reservations for hotel rooms and car rentals.
Bot, Intent, and Slot models which are compatible with this sample can be found in the Lex Console
as part of the 'BookTrip' template.

For instructions on how to set up and test this bot, as well as additional samples,
visit the Lex Getting Started documentation https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/getting-started.html.
